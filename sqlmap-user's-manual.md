# Abstract
This document is the user's manual for [sqlmap](http://www.sqlmap.org).

# Introduction
sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.

## Requirements
sqlmap is developed in [python](http://www.python.org), a dynamic, object-oriented, interpreted programming language freely available from [http://python.org/download/](http://python.org/download/). This makes sqlmap a cross-platform application which is independant of the operating system. sqlmap requires Python version **2.6** or above. To make it even easier, many GNU/Linux distributions come out of the box with Python installed. Other Unixes and Mac OSX also provide Python packaged and ready to be installed. Windows users can download and install the Python installer for x86, AMD64 and Itanium.

sqlmap relies on the [Metasploit Framework](http://metasploit.com) for some of its post-exploitation takeover features. You need to grab a copy of the framework from the [download](http://metasploit.com/download/) page - the required version is **3.5** or higher. For the ICMP tunneling out-of-band takeover technique, sqlmap requires the [Impacket](http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&amp;action=view&amp;type=tool&amp;name=Impacket) library too.

If you are willing to connect directly to a database server (switch `-d`), without passing through the web application, you need to install Python bindings for the database management system that you are going to attack:

* Firebird: [python-kinterbasdb](http://kinterbasdb.sourceforge.net/)
* Microsoft Access: [python-pyodbc](http://pyodbc.googlecode.com/)
* Microsoft SQL Server: [python-pymssql](http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/)
* MySQL: [python pymysql](http://code.google.com/p/pymysql/)
* Oracle: [python cx_Oracle](http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/)
* PostgreSQL: [python-psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)
* SQLite: [python-pysqlite2](http://pysqlite.googlecode.com/)
* Sybase: [python-pymssql](http://pymssql.sourceforge.net/)

If you plan to attack a web application behind NTLM authentication or use the sqlmap update functionality (switch `--update`) you need to install respectively [python-ntlm](http://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/) and [python-svn](http://pysvn.tigris.org/) libraries respectively.

Optionally, if you are running sqlmap on Windows, you may wish to install the [PyReadline](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro) library in order to take advantage of the sqlmap TAB completion and history support features in the SQL shell and OS shell. Note that these functionalities are available natively via the standard Python [readline](http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html) library on other operating systems.

## Scenario

### Detect and exploit a SQL injection
Let's say that you are auditing a web application and found a web page that accepts dynamic user-provided values via `GET`, `POST` or `Cookie` parameters or via the HTTP `User-Agent` request header.
You now want to test if these are affected by a SQL injection vulnerability, and if so, exploit them to retrieve as much information as possible from the back-end database management system, or even be able to access the underlying file system and operating system.

In a simple world, consider that the target url is:
`http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1`

Assume that:
`http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=1`

is the same page as the original one and (the condition evaluates to **True**):
`http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1+AND+1=2`

differs from the original one (the condition evaluates to **False**). This likely means that you are in front of a SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` `GET` parameter of the `index.php` page. Additionally, no sanitisation of user's supplied input is taking place before the SQL statement is sent to the back-end database management system.

This is quite a common flaw in dynamic content web applications and it does not depend upon the back-end database management system nor on the web application programming language; it is a flaw within the application code. The [Open Web Application Security Project](http://www.owasp.org) rated this class of vulnerability as the [most common](http://owasptop10.googlecode.com/files/OWASP%20Top%2010%20-%202010.pdf) and serious web application vulnerability in their [Top Ten](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) list from 2010.

Now that you have found the vulnerable parameter, you can exploit it by manipulating the `id` parameter value in the HTTP request.

Back to the scenario, we can make an educated guess about the probable syntax of the SQL `SELECT` statement where the user supplied value is being used in the `get_int.php` web page. In pseudo PHP code:

`$query = "SELECT [column name(s)] FROM [table name] WHERE id=" . $_REQUEST['id'];`

As you can see, appending a syntactically valid SQL statement that will evaluate to a **True** condition after the value for the `id` parameter (such as `id=1 AND 1=1`) will result in the web application returning the same web page as in the original request (where no SQL statement is added).
This is because the back-end database management system has evaluated the
injected SQL statement. The previous example describes a simple boolean-based blind SQL injection
vulnerability.  However, sqlmap is able to detect any type of SQL injection flaw and adapt
its work-flow accordingly. 

In this simple scenario it would also be possible to append, not just one or more valid SQL conditions, but also (depending on the DBMS) stacked SQL queries. For instance:  `[...]&id=1;ANOTHER SQL QUERY#`.

sqlmap can automate the process of identifying and exploiting this type of vulnerability. Passing the original address, `http://192.168.136.131/sqlmap/mysql/get_int.php?id=1` to sqlmap, the tool will automatically:

* Identify the vulnerable parameter(s) (`id` in this example)
* Identify which SQL injection techniques can be used to exploit the
vulnerable parameter(s)
* Fingerprint the back-end database management system
* Depending on the user's options, it will extensively fingerprint,
enumerate data or takeover the database server as a whole

...and depending on supplied options, it will enumerate data or takeover the
database server entirely.

There exist many [resources](http://delicious.com/inquis/sqlinjection) on the web explaining in depth how to detect, exploit and prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It is recommendeded that you read them before going much further with sqlmap.

### Direct connection to the database management system
Up until sqlmap version **0.8**, the tool has been **yet another SQL injection tool**, used by web application penetration testers/newbies/curious teens/computer addicted/punks and so on. Things move on
and as they evolve, we do as well. Now it supports this new switch, `-d`, that allows you to connect from your machine to the database server's TCP port where the database management system daemon is listening
on and perform any operation you would do while using it to attack a database via a SQL injection vulnerability.

## Techniques

sqlmap is able to detect and exploit five different SQL injection **types**:

* **Boolean-based blind SQL injection**, also known as **inferential SQL injection**: sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a `SELECT` sub-statement, or any other SQL statement whose the user want to retrieve the output. For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response headers/body with the original request, the tool inference the output of the injected statement character by character. Alternatively, the user can provide a string or regular expression to match on True pages. The bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap to perform this technique is able to fetch each character of the output with a maximum of seven HTTP requests. Where the output is not within the clear-text plain charset, sqlmap will adapt the algorithm with bigger ranges to detect the output.
* **Time-based blind SQL injection**, also known as **full blind SQL injection**: sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP request, a syntatically valid SQL statement string containing a query which put on hold the back-end DBMS to return for a certain number of seconds. For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP response time with the original request, the tool inference the output of the injected statement character by character. Like for boolean-based technique, the bisection algorithm is applied.
* **Error-based SQL injection**: sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter a database-specific error message provoking statement and parses the HTTP response headers and body in search of DBMS error messages containing the injected pre-defined chain of characters and the subquery statement output within. This technique works only when the web application has been configured to disclose back-end database management system error messages.
* **UNION query SQL injection**, also known as **inband SQL injection**: sqlmap appends to the affected parameter a syntactically valid SQL statement starting with an `UNION ALL SELECT`. This techique works when the web application page passes directly the output of the `SELECT` statement within a `for` loop, or similar, so that each line of the query output is printed on the page content. sqlmap is also able to exploit **partial (single entry) UNION query SQL injection** vulnerabilities which occur when the output of the statement is not cycled in a `for` construct, whereas only the first entry of the query output is displayed.
* **Stacked queries SQL injection**, also known as **multiple statements SQL injection**: sqlmap tests if the web application supports stacked queries and then, in case it does support, it appends to the affected
parameter in the HTTP request, a semi-colon (`;`) followed by the SQL statement to be executed. This technique is useful to run SQL statements other than `SELECT`, like for instance, **data definition** or **data manipulation** statements, possibly leading to file system read and write access and operating system command execution depending on the underlying back-end database management system and the session user privileges.

## Demo
You can watch several demo videos, they are hosted on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/inquisb).

# Features
Features implemented in sqlmap include:
## Generic features
* Full support for **MySQL**, **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL**, **Microsoft SQL Server**, **Microsoft Access**, **SQLite**, **Firebird**, **Sybase** and **SAP MaxDB** database management systems.
* Full support for five SQL injection techniques: **boolean-based blind**, **time-based blind**, **error-based**, **UNION query** and **stacked queries**.
* Support to **directly connect to the database** without passing via a SQL injection, by providing DBMS credentials, IP address, port and database name.
* It is possible to provide a single target URL, get the list of targets from [Burp proxy](http://portswigger.net/suite/) or [WebScarab proxy](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project) requests log files, get the whole HTTP request from a text file or get the list of targets by providing sqlmap with a Google dork which queries [Google](http://www.google.com) search engine and parses its results page. You can also define a regular-expression based scope that is used to identify which of the parsed addresses to test.
* Tests provided **GET** parameters, **POST** parameters, HTTP **Cookie** header values, HTTP **User-Agent** header value and HTTP **Referer** header value to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is also possible to specify a comma-separated list of specific parameter(s) to test.
* Option to specify the **maximum number of concurrent HTTP(S) requests (multi-threading)** to speed up the blind SQL injection techniques. Vice versa, it is also possible to specify the number of seconds to hold between each HTTP(S) request. Others optimization switches to speed up the exploitation are implemented too.
* **HTTP `Cookie` header** string support, useful when the web application requires authentication based upon cookies and you have such data or in case you just want to test for and exploit SQL injection on such header values. You can also specify to always URL-encode the Cookie.
* Automatically handles **HTTP `Set-Cookie` header** from the application, re-establishing of the session if it expires. Test and exploit on these values is supported too. Vice versa, you can also force to ignore any `Set-Cookie` header.
* HTTP protocol **Basic, Digest, NTLM and Certificate authentications** support.
* **HTTP(S) proxy** support to pass by the requests to the target application that works also with HTTPS requests and with authenticated proxy servers.
* Options to fake the **HTTP `Referer` header** value and the **HTTP `User-Agent` header** value specified by user or randomly selected from a textual file.
* Support to increase the **verbosity level of output messages**: there exist **seven levels** of verbosity.
* Support to **parse HTML forms** from the target URL and forge HTTP(S) requests against those pages to test the form parameters against vulnerabilities.
* **Granularity and flexibility** in terms of both user's switches and features.
* **Estimated time of arrival** support for each query, updated in real time, to provide the user with an overview on how long it will take to retrieve the queries' output.
* Automatically saves the session (queries and their output, even if partially retrieved) on a textual file in real time while fetching the data and **resumes the injection** by parsing the session file.
* Support to read options from a configuration INI file rather than specify each time all of the switches on the command line. Support also to generate a configuration file based on the command line switches provided.
* Support to **replicate the back-end database tables structure and entries** on a local SQLite 3 database.
* Option to update sqlmap to the latest development version from the subversion repository.
* Support to parse HTTP(S) responses and display any DBMS error message to the user.
* Integration with other IT security open source projects, (http://metasploit.com "Metasploit) and [w3af](http://w3af.sourceforge.net/).

## Fingerprint and enumeration features
* **Extensive back-end database software version and underlying operating system fingerprint** based upon
[error messages](http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html),
[banner parsing](http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/06/database-management-system-fingerprint.html),
[functions output comparison](http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html) and [specific features](http://bernardodamele.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-on-database-management-system.html) such as MySQL comment injection. It is also possible to force the back-end database management system name if you already know it.
* Basic web server software and web application technology fingerprint.
* Support to retrieve the DBMS **banner**, **session user** and **current database** information. The tool can also check if the session user is a **database administrator** (DBA).
* Support to enumerate **database users**, **users' password hashes**, **users' privileges**, **users' roles**, **databases**, **tables** and **columns**.
* Automatic recognition of password hashes format and support to **crack them with a dictionary-based attack**.
* Support to **brute-force tables and columns name**. This is useful when the session user has no read access over the system table containing schema information or when the database management system does
not store this information anywhere (e.g. MySQL < 5.0).
* Support to **dump database tables** entirely, a range of entries or specific columns as per user's choice. The user can also choose to dump only a range of characters from each column's entry.
* Support to automatically **dump all databases**' schemas and entries. It is possibly to exclude from the dump the system databases.
* Support to **search for specific database names, specific tables across all databases or specific columns across all databases' tables**. This is useful, for instance, to identify tables containing custom application credentials where relevant columns' names contain string like **name** and **pass**.
* Support to **run custom SQL statement(s)** as in an interactive SQL client connecting to the back-end database. sqlmap automatically dissects the provided statement, determines which technique fits best to inject it and how to pack the SQL payload accordingly.

## Takeover features
Some of these techniques are detailed in the white paper
[Advanced SQL injection to operating system full control](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/advanced-sql-injection-to-operating-system-full-control-whitepaper-4633857) and in the
slide deck [Expanding the control over the operating system from the database](http://www.slideshare.net/inquis/expanding-the-control-over-the-operating-system-from-the-database).
* Support to **inject custom user-defined functions**: the user can compile a shared library then use sqlmap to create within the back-end DBMS user-defined functions out of the compiled shared library file. These
UDFs can then be executed, and optionally removed, via sqlmap. This is supported when the database software is MySQL or PostgreSQL.
* Support to **download and upload any file** from the database server underlying file system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
* Support to **execute arbitrary commands and retrieve their standard output** on the database server underlying operating system when the database software is MySQL, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.
* On MySQL and PostgreSQL via user-defined function injection and execution.
* On Microsoft SQL Server via `xp_cmdshell()` stored procedure.
Also, the stored procedure is re-enabled if disabled or created from scratch if removed by the DBA.
* Support to **establish an out-of-band stateful TCP connection between the attacker machine and the database server** underlying operating system. This channel can be an interactive command prompt, a Meterpreter session or a graphical user interface (VNC) session as per user's choice.
sqlmap relies on Metasploit to create the shellcode and implements four different techniques to execute it on the database server. These techniques are:
* Database **in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode** via sqlmap own user-defined function `sys_bineval()`. Supported on MySQL and PostgreSQL.
* Upload and execution of a Metasploit's **stand-alone payload stager** via sqlmap own user-defined function `sys_exec()` on MySQL and PostgreSQL or via `xp_cmdshell()` on Microsoft SQL Server.
* Execution of Metasploit's shellcode by performing a **SMB reflection attack** (
[MS08-068](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-068.mspx) with a UNC path request from the database server to the attacker's machine where the Metasploit `smb_relay` server exploit listens. Supported when running sqlmap with high privileges (`uid=0`) on Linux/Unix and the target DBMS runs as Administrator on Windows.
* Database in-memory execution of the Metasploit's shellcode by exploiting **Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005 `sp_replwritetovarbin` stored procedure heap-based buffer overflow** (
[MS09-004](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-004.mspx)). sqlmap has its own exploit to trigger the vulnerability with automatic DEP memory protection bypass, but it relies on Metasploit to generate the shellcode to get executed upon successful exploitation.
* Support for **database process' user privilege escalation** via Metasploit's `getsystem` command which include, among others, the 
[kitrap0d](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-01/0346.html) technique (
[MS10-015](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms10-015.mspx)).
* Support to access (read/add/delete) Windows registry hives.
